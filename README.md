The product is intended to be a standalone, single page application that is designed to be mobile first, but work equally as well on desktops. The application will allow the user to manipulate the database using a simple interface which connects front-end components to server side endpoints to achieve this result.

## Project Overview

The product is intended to be a standalone, single page application that is designed to be mobile first, but work equally as well on desktops. The application will allow the user to manipulate the database using a simple interface which connects front-end components to server side endpoints to achieve this result.

## Minimum skill set

The ability to deploy the following will be required to complete this project. Some of these topics you will have gained a grounding in with Code Academy but you will also need to be able to apply the techniques that you learnt from the extra course work that I have provided you with.
 - HTML / CSS (preferably with a framework)
 - JavaScript
 - JQuery DOM manipulation / AJAX
 - PHP with JSON encoding / MySQL or MariaDB
 
 To smooth the process, I have prepared a SQL script that will enable you to create a database containing the tables required to model the company data.

## Development environment

To prototype and develop solutions locally on your PC and test them before promoting them to the live environment you will have to configure a web server with PHP support on your PC. The following resources cover the three major operating systems: Windows: **IIS, XAMPP** or **WAMP, Mac, Ubuntu**

A good alternative to installing these web servers directly onto your PC is to create a virtual machine environment using ORACLE VirtualBox.
